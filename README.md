## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I created this simple design while taking the Responsive Web Design course from FreeCodeCamp. At that time I had only a superficial understanding of JavaScript. Later I took the course "The Complete JavaScript Course: From Zero to Expert!" by brilliant Jonas Schmedtmann. After learning some of the most frequently used DOM manipulations, I decided to return to this project and implement my knowledge in order to make the page more interactive.

Features included:

- Email validation (Error messages both for an empty field and an incorrect format);
- Refresh the page (Page reload when the user clicks on the logo image);
- Smooth scrolling to the relevant section (User gets smooth scrolling when clicking on the navigation elements);
- Fade-in/fade-out navigation menu (When the user hovers mouse on one of the navigation elements, the rest of the navbar fades out);
- Sticky navigation menu (Using JavaScript);
- Slider component (Swipe user reviews by clicking on buttons, arrow keys or dots).

### Continued development

I would like to increase the scale of my future projects both in terms of content and functionality.
